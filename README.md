# Capri Bezel LED

![Capri Bezel LED preview](preview.png)

Music Light adds a diffuse, moving RGB glow around your primary display. It pulses to music, with an extra brightness boost on detected bass hits. The overlay fades inward and lets mouse clicks pass through.

## Installation

1. Download [capri-bezel-led.capri-code](capri-bezel-led.capri-code).
2. Open **Mainframe → CAPRI → Mods → Import mod** and select the file.
3. Approve the code mod when prompted.
4. Use **Mainframe → Settings → Capri → Music Light** to enable or disable the effect.

## Changelog

### v0.6.1

- The render and bass workers prefer E-cores on supported Intel hybrid CPUs. Windows can still schedule them on other cores.
- On AMD and systems without detected Intel E-cores, Windows continues to choose where the workers run.
- Added bass-reactive flashes using Windows playback audio. Bass detection runs in the background while Capri detects music.
- Kept the diffuse RGB renderer and existing fullscreen and taskbar behavior.

### Changes since v0.5.2

- Moved RGB pixel rendering off Capri's UI thread and reused pixel buffers. The renderer now calculates corner and color values per column, and the mod checks less often when idle.
- Registered the Music Light row with the Mainframe settings layout so it scrolls with the other controls.
- The glow follows the desktop work area and extends to the monitor edges in fullscreen. Cached strips resize together when switching modes to keep the bottom corners joined.

### v0.5.2

- Initial public release.

## Compatibility

Windows code mod for [Capri Desktop](https://github.com/lachydotmcg/capri-desktop). The mod uses internal Capri interfaces for music detection, audio capture, and Mainframe controls. Future Capri releases may require an update.
